              <br>
              <p>Indonesia is facing an aging population, with the majority of elderly people living with their families and experiencing health issues. However, not all family members have the knowledge and ability to provide adequate care for them. This highlights the need for experienced elderly caregivers and knowledge of elderly care. Unfortunately, such resources are not yet available centrally and are currently scattered on the internet, resulting in less effective and guaranteed support.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Then, the big question arises, ‚ùì<br>
                "How to meet the needs of experienced elderly caregivers and their knowledge of aged care on one centralized platform".</p>
              <br>
              <p>We, C23-PS276, a Capstone Team from <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka</span> decided to make a mobile application that can provide information on senior care as well as the option to call a caregiver, we named it "Sahabat Lansia".</p>
              <br>
              <p>Meet the team that's making Sahabat Lansia possible‚Äîa group of dedicated and skilled individuals:<br>
                1. R. Damanhuri - Machine Learning<br>
                2. Muhammad Farkhan Adhitama - Machine Learning<br>
                3. Adelia A'fa Nafasha - Cloud Computing<br>
                4. Rosalina Injilia Karinda - Cloud Computing<br>
                5. Muhammad Akmal Firmansyah - Mobile Development<br>
                6. Archangela Muhammad Alvaro - Mobile Development</p>
              <br>
              <p>The increasing number of elderly people requires accurate care information and easy-to-find caregivers. We want to solve this issue of aged care by providing for these two needs because we believe that everyone deserves the best care and support, especially in old age. Moreover, we recognize that technology can play an important role in supporting this situation.</p>

              <p>Hey everyone!</p>
              <br>
              <p>I would like to share one of my experiences at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka</span>, on what I've been able to achieve after a Soft Skill Session about Adaptability and Resiliance led by Bangkit's instructor Kak Yasmin Shahab.</p>
              <br>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Ways of Interacting</span></p>
              <br>
              <p>Bangkit's Academy is a place where people come from diverse backgrounds and with different communication styles. In order to communicate effectively, I'm starting to adjust my behavior and attitude based on the situation I'm in. For example, being able to switch between being assertive and collaborative depending on the circumstances.</p>
              <br>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Ways of Achieving</span></p>
              <br>
              <p>A lot of tasks are given by Bangkit's team to the cohorts, which require high concentration to successfully complete them. Therefore, I'm starting to adjust my timeline and finish some tasks way early before reaching the deadlines so that I'm able to shift my focus from one goal to another.</p>
              <br>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Ways of Learning</span></p>
              <br>
              <p>Learning materials can be accessed anywhere and anytime. There are also various sources, such as books, videos, people, etc. If I didn't get enough information from that specific source, there is always another source that I can use to help me learn. Overreliance on a solitary information source should be avoided!.</p>
              <br>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Ways of Working</span></p>
              <br>
              <p>Bangkit's academy provided tasks individually, which most of the time needed a huge amount of time to spend, and also projects/discussions that needed to be done by a team. Therefore, I need to learn how to be able to work independently or collaboratively, be able to switch between tasks and projects, and be able to adjust our work schedule based on the demands of the situation.</p>
              <br>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Ways of Thinking</span></p>
              <br>
              <p>Fixed mindset should be avoided, consider on developing a growth mindset. This involves being open to new ideas and perspectives, being able to challenge our assumptions, and being able to think critically and creatively.</p>

            <div class="story">
                <p>Hey everyone! üëã</p>
                <br>
                <p>I would like to share one of my experiences at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka</span>, which is learning how to manage our time effectively. The session was led by Bangkit's instructor, Kak Dita Widy Amallya. It was an insightful experience, and I learned a lot of things.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In terms of managing our time, most of us will probably think,<br>
                    "Do I need to be responsible with my own time?"<br>
                    "How do I plan my work when I have multiple conflicting tasks?"<br>
                    "How do I prioritize my tasks?" and so much more.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>These are the things I can sum up from the session, and it led me to establish ways to overcome them.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Executing monotasking rather than multitasking.</span><br>
                    I realized that doing things simultaneously wasn't actually maximizing my effort on each work or project because my focus would be divided among a lot of things. By executing multitasking, not just my mind will be affected by the situation; it will also make me a little stressed because of the pressure that it puts on me. This will lead me to think,</p>
                <br>
                <p>"As long as the tasks are complete, then I should be fine."</p>
                <br>
                <p>This kind of mindset should be avoided because it will prevent you from developing your mindset. That's why every time I had some tasks. I will make a schedule out of it, set a reminder, find a conducive place, and then complete the tasks one by one according to the schedule.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Enforcing self-discipline.</span><br>
                    There are five principles that we need to follow in order to develop it.<br>
                    - Finding a strong reason before doing tasks.<br>
                    - Create rituals and turn them into habits.<br>
                    - Be accountable.<br>
                    - Determine self-rewards and punishments.<br>
                    - Discipling the mind.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Prioritizing tasks with the Eisenhower Matrix.</span><br>
                    In order to find what's important and what's urgent on my task list, I tried the Eisenhower Matrix to divide it into four quadrants and make decisions based on the quadrants.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-style: italic;">- Quadrant 1: Urgent and important</span><br>
                    This is the one I need to prioritize over the other quadrants. A little bit stressful at first, but it will lead into a better future.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-style: italic;">- Quadrant 2: Not urgent yet important</span><br>
                    This is where I should focus and spend my time. It is all about planning. Addressing these matters helps me do the task more effectively.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-style: italic;">- Quadrant 4: Not urgent and not important</span><br>
                    This quadrant is where I should drop my tasks because they will just waste a lot of my time.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Cheers,</p>
                <br>
